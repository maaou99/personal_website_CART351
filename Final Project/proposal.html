        <div id="question-1">
            <h5>What is your starting topic? What importance does it hold for you? For others? Why is it important to make this topic into an explorable networked space?
            </h5>
            <p>Our starting point was based on user needs, hobbies, and preferences. By focusing on a particular niche, we are creating an opportunity to enhance their day-to-day tasks and provide a space for others to connect based on shared interests.
            </p>
            <p>For this project, we will be creating an online community and user dashboard for plant lovers. We believe this project is important because it brings joy, satisfaction, and knowledge to people who regularly buy and enjoy taking care of their plants. In our increasingly digital world, we sometimes forget to appreciate what is around us. Therefore, this online web app highlights the importance of creating opportunities that allow users to leverage their physical interaction with the plant. Since there is no direct dependency on the app, the interaction between the user and the app will be considered a mindful and relaxing activity. While the app serves as a tool for plant care, it is not necessary to use it in order evaluate the plants health. Users will feel a sense of self-nourishment and gratitude after using the app by taking the necessary actions to maintain the overall health of a plant.</p>
            <p>We have noticed that learning about plants and taking care of them can sometimes be a lonely experience, as plant hobbyists try to figure out the best way to care for their plants (such as determining the right amount of sunlight and water, or the ideal temperature for quick growth). This app will enable instant communication between people with the same interests, fostering a greater love for plants as users learn and adopt new ways of maintaining healthy plants.</p>
        </div>
    

        <div id="question-2"  >
            <h5>Think about the kind of relationship you wish to encourage between your users and this space. How can you use this space to destabilize the users and make them reflect on themselves, their environment and society?
            </h5>
            <p>The aim is to foster a meaningful relationship between users and the app's environment, leading to self-reflection and contemplation about themselves, their surroundings, and society. This can be achieved through the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Building trust in the information provided by the app.
                </li>
                <li>Encouraging users to develop a bond with their plants, creating a sense of care and connection.</li>
                <li>Facilitating self-reflection as users engage in the activity of providing attention and care to a living species</li>
                <li>Promoting a feeling of inner peace and enjoyment during the plant care experience.
                </li>
                <li>Encouraging users to physically interact with the plants, stimulating their senses and fostering mindfulness in the present moment.
                </li>
                <li> Creating awareness about the importance of nature and its role in providing clean air and other essential benefits, thereby promoting environmental consciousness.
                </li>
                <li>Cultivating a sense of community among users, fostering a shared interest in plant care and providing opportunities for interaction and collaboration.
                </li>
               
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="question-3" >
            <h5>Think about the notion of empowerment. Will your "space" help, challenge, teach, enable collaboration, understanding between user(s)? How and Why?
            </h5>
            <p>Empowerment is important because it enables individuals to recognize and credit themselves for what they deserve. When one becomes empowered, depreciation of self lessens as one starts the process of production of self which helps immensely with confidence.
            </p>
            <p>This platform will be a highly collaborative space that serves as a hub for valuable information about the various listed plants, allowing users to help and teach each other based on their shared interest and passion. 
            </p>
            <p>The uniqueness of the app lies in the fact that it encourages a community and a community will in return encourage activity. Being seen as a part of a community, gives a sense of belonging which could be extremely empowering as well as healing. 
        </p>
            <p>Additionally, the fostered connection to nature is also empowering in a sense that grounds oneself into the tangible and physical environment. Acts like gardening have proven to show therapeutic sensations for the brain, offering a respite from the chaos of everyday life, and promoting mindfulness. 
            </p>
            <p>Focusing on something uncaringly alive, putting modest effort into its low maintenance life,and getting to see it thrive is truly satisfying. This confirmation of one's effort in the plant's survival is also empowering. This process does not necessarily rely on a community but can immensely benefit from it, making our app truly unique in its approach.

        <div id="themes-elements">
            <h4>Themes and major elements of the project</h4>
                <u>First Question</u>
                <p>A crucial aspect of this project is bringing humans and plants closer to each other. This connection will be enabled through the use of sensors and a robust network infrastructure to seamlessly transfer data. Our technology is designed not only to gather information about the plant but also to provide the plant with insights about us. This reciprocal exchange of data serves as the foundation for a deeper mutual comprehension. Furthermore we envision creating a space for the plant to interact with humans, for example, through sounds, subtle signaling or even eavesdropping on our conversations. This approach not only promises a better understanding of plants and their needs, but also the ability to be in dialogue with them. Such a space can only be facilitated by an external factor that intermediates between the two entities that have no easy way of communication or mutual understandment due to their biological differences. Therefore, the collected data will undergo translation, transforming it into information that is both comprehensible and easily accessible to humans. 
                </p>
                <u>Second Question</u>
                <p>In todayâ€™s digital age, it's easy for people to forget to appreciate what is around them while increasingly nurturing their online presence and existence in the digital world. This online web app steers away from conventional socializing apps to show that these technologies can facilitate a connection to surrounding and nature rather than impede it.  
                </p>
                <p>The app places a strong emphasis on respecting user trust through deliberate design choices regarding the management of information. (the type of information it keeps, and where that information can be used). For example, it incorporates a personal tab to keep track of all the data which could be privately accessed and a community tab where one can see other people's progress, their achievements. All information they choose to make public.
                </p>
                <p>Furthermore the app has a dedicated tab that provides real-time updates on the plant's status. Metrics like its moisture level of the soil, the dryness of the roots, and more general information such as the age of the plant (if known), the last watering date etc. All real-time data received by the app is diligently recorded and presented in this section. Moreover, users can login into their account to monitor the plant and oberse the progress of its growth. 
                </p>
                <p>Users have the flexibility to customize their experience by setting up notifications for these specific parameters, ensuring that they stay informed throughout the day. Additionally, users can establish criticality thresholds, automating notifications when specific traits reach a level of importance</p>
                <u>Third Question</u>
                <p> The uniqueness of the app lies in the fact that it encourages a community and a community will in return encourage activity. When people connect with others in this app, they have numerous ways to interact with each other, including likes, forums, comments. Being seen as a part of a community, gives a sense of belonging which could be extremely empowering as well as healing. Users can meet, find and connect with people on the app either through the community tab, forums,their shared plant interests, or user IDs.Since users are categorized primarily based on plants they have claimed (could be location as well), interactions occur more organically, guided by algorithms rather than enforced connections. 
                </p>
                <p>Note that this process does not necessarily rely on a community but can immensely benefit from it, making our app truly unique in its approach.
                    Additionally, the fostered connection to nature is also empowering in a sense that grounds oneself into the tangible and physical environment. This experience is facilitated through intentionality which is itself empowering. In a way, although this app enhances the connection, it doesn't override any roles in a process of atomization ( i.e making the plant take care of itself) As the human is still the main caregiver here. It just creates a better communication channel, enriching the relationship.

            <p>Compare & Contrast: Twitter</p>
            <p>The article "The machine always wins: what drives our addiction to social media" by The Guardian highlights the potential addictive impact of social media on users, particularly Twitter.   As our platform involves interaction between online users, it is necessary to highlight the similarities and differences between our social platform and popular social media platforms like Twitter. The article explains that users experience joy and excitement when using social media platforms, which acts as a satisfying reward. This creates a constant desire to stay on the app and continue seeking this feeling. This leads to the development of addictive behavior, as users become dependent on the instant joy provided.
            </p>
            <p>According to the article, one of the noteworthy observations made is the impact that Twitter has on users, taking them into a timeless zone where the traditional sense of day and night seems to dissolve. This phenomenon is associated with the immersive nature of the platform, where users can easily get lost in a seemingly endless stream of videos to watch and threads to reply to. As a result, individuals tend to lose track of time and reduce their exposure to natural daylight.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Planta App</p>
            <p>This existing app provides you the opportunity to take care of you plant. The target user base are mostly seasoned plant enthusiast who regularly buy and water their plants. It can identify your plant and let you know when it time to water. The app can also determine the amount of light required for your plant. The user dashboard provides an overview of your plant collection, allowing you to keep track of the number of plants you own and their individual care requirements. A clean and modern UI can make navigation more smoother and allow quick seamless interventions from the user.
            </p>
            <p>With Planta App, you can identify your plants by taking a photo. The app utilizes advanced image recognition technology to instantly provide you with plant species information. It keeps track of watering schedules and sends timely reminders.</p>
            <p> It also aims to foster a sense of connection and care between you and your plants. By engaging in the activity of providing attention and care to living species, you can experience a feeling of self-reflection and contemplation. The app encourages mindfulness in the present moment as you physically interact with your plants, stimulating your senses and promoting inner peace and enjoyment.

            <p>Tumblr</p>
            <p>Tumblr is a microblogging and social media platform that has thrived over the years.Tumblr encourages users to engage with one another through likes, reblogs, and comments. This interaction helps users connect with like-minded individuals, discover new content, and build a sense of belonging within the platform. The platform's structure is designed to make content sharing easy and interactive, thus fostering a vibrant community of content creators. Due to its design and safe space it creates it's easy to find niche communities within tumblr dedicated to different topics. Tumblr has played a significant role in internet culture, meme culture, and the spread of social and political movements. Its impact on shaping online discourse is a testament to the strength of its community.

<br><br>
        <div id="diff/simili">
            <h4>Differences form existing platforms</h4>
            <p>Twitter promotes addictive behavior as users become dependent on instant joy. Our app, on the other hand, focuses on consistent and gradual plant growth instead of instant gratification. Users observe the progress of their plants and need to be patient. Unlike social media platforms, our platform emphasizes achieving a healthy and thriving plant in the long term.
            </p>
            <p>Common social media platforms create an illusion of infinite videos and threads, allowing us to escape the real world. However, this leads to losing track of time and reducing exposure to daylight. Our app encourages users to bring sunlight into their homes, supporting their love for plants and enhancing their interest.
            </p>
            <p>We have come across another digital product similar to ours called Planta. Our platform not only promotes and simplifies the daily care of plants but also fosters a sense of community among users. Through shared posts from fellow plant enthusiasts, users can learn more about plants.  In addition, our users have the ability to visualize other plants owned by other users in their vicinity, promoting a sense of collective interest among plant enthusiast.
            </p>
            <p>Some Tumblr communities can be toxic, with issues like cyberbullying, harassment, and hate speech. Furthermore, as with many social media platforms, Tumblr collects user data for various purposes, including advertising. Concerns about data privacy and how user data is used can be a drawback for some users.
            </p>
            <p>It can take a negative turn when people discover like-minded people who share their passion, creating an echo chamber of affirmation, something that can be observed as a symptom of Tumblr. Our app by its very subject discourages this kind of behavior. Although users predominantly interact with those they share similar views and preferences with.  The goal of it is to materialize into plant and human interaction and not to promote a certain narrative or biases.</p>
           <p>Overall, users' experiences on Tumblr can vary widely depending on their interests, the communities they engage with, and how they use the platform.
